## Guiding the Agent: Instructions (`instruction`)

The `instruction` parameter is arguably the most critical for shaping an
`LlmAgent`'s behavior. It's a string (or a function returning a string) that
tells the agent:

* Its core task or goal.
* Its personality or persona (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant," "You are a witty pirate").
* Constraints on its behavior (e.g., "Only answer questions about X," "Never reveal Y").
* How and when to use its `tools`. You should explain the purpose of each tool and the circumstances under which it should be called, supplementing any descriptions within the tool itself.
* The desired format for its output (e.g., "Respond in JSON," "Provide a bulleted list").

**Tips for Effective Instructions:**

* **Be Clear and Specific:** Avoid ambiguity. Clearly state the desired actions and outcomes.
* **Use Markdown:** Improve readability for complex instructions using headings, lists, etc.
* **Provide Examples (Few-Shot):** For complex tasks or specific output formats, include examples directly in the instruction.
* **Guide Tool Use:** Don't just list tools; explain *when* and *why* the agent should use them.

**State:**

* The instruction is a string template, you can use the `{var}` syntax to insert dynamic values into the instruction.
* `{var}` is used to insert the value of the state variable named var.
* `{artifact.var}` is used to insert the text content of the artifact named var.
* If the state variable or artifact does not exist, the agent will raise an error. If you want to ignore the error, you can append a `?` to the variable name as in `{var?}`.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Example: Adding instructions
    capital_agent = LlmAgent(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash",
        name="capital_agent",
        description="Answers user questions about the capital city of a given country.",
        instruction="""You are an agent that provides the capital city of a country.
    When a user asks for the capital of a country:
    1. Identify the country name from the user's query.
    2. Use the `get_capital_city` tool to find the capital.
    3. Respond clearly to the user, stating the capital city.
    Example Query: "What's the capital of {country}?"
    Example Response: "The capital of France is Paris."
    """,
        # tools will be added next
    )
    ```

    ### Managing Context (`include_contents`)

Control whether the agent receives the prior conversation history.

* **`include_contents` (Optional, Default: `'default'`):** Determines if the `contents` (history) are sent to the LLM.
    * `'default'`: The agent receives the relevant conversation history.
    * `'none'`: The agent receives no prior `contents`. It operates based solely on its current instruction and any input provided in the *current* turn (useful for stateless tasks or enforcing specific contexts).
